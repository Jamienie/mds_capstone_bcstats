# Introduction
-	Looking at how the qualitative responses match to related multiple choice questions
-	Determine if sentiment matches between both types of responses
-	Look into why they don't agree
o	May be mc questions don't match well with sub theme
-	Help to backup results of survey and confirm that both reports (qual & quant) are saying the same thing
-	Explain parts of mc that could be improved
-	Match mc and subthemes - explain parts to be improved 

The Work Environment Survey (WES) collects quantitative data through multiple choice questions with a 5-point scale. One main short answer question is asked which forms the qualitative data. Being able to relate the qualitative and quantitative data can strengthen the results of the WES. 
The hypothesis is that the topic present in the short answer question will correspond to a negative rating in the related multiple-choice questions. An example would be the short answer question relates to laptop software and that they have a negative response in the multiple-choice questions about computer software. 


# Methods

-	Relate comment subthemes to related mc questions
-	Remove all positive tags and assume all comments are negative 
-	Bin mc responses to pos, neg and neutral 
-	Subtheme can match to multiple mc questions
-	Mc questions can have from 0 to 1+ subthemes
-	Generalize up to main themes 

To be able to relate the short answer questions to the multiple-choice questions on the sub-theme level, each multiple-choice question was matched to a sub-theme. Not all multiple-choice questions were matched to a sub-theme and some were matched to multiple sub-themes. Three independent raters matched the sub-theme to the multiple-choice questions and looked at the inter-rater agreement to help quantify the quality of the matching. 
The short answer question is designed to generate negative responses but sometimes there are positive comments supplied. All positive codes were removed as they did not relate to a specific sub-theme which assumes all remaining codes are negative. 
The multiple-choice responses were binned into three groups: negative, neutral and positive. 
To  determine the level of agreement the sentiment was compared and calculated to be either strong, medium or weak, based on differences shown in table xx. 
The sub-theme level agreement was generalized to the main theme level. 

# Discussion

- do not start writing until inter-rater stuff done and final sub-theme mc done
- discuss sub-theme--mc matching
   - visualization to show which sub-themes appeared multiple times to which didn't at all 
   - lack of flexible work mc 



# Results & Recommendations

- summary table showing top 5 strong and top 5 weak

## Comments and To do's

- write some more unit tests/double check filter conditions

- create table/appendix that lists sub-themes, their names and main theme groups

- fix names

- start writing

- why does img html tag have to go from back to render properly
