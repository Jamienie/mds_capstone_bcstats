    "This notebook shows the summaries for specific subthemes and agreement levels. The purpose of this is to help explain the different groupings of agreement levels to determine potential areas for improve in the WES design. The summaries can be made for all the text, a specific sub-theme or theme and various agreement levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions for use\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook can be used to create summaries for text. You can select which subtheme and agreement level you want to look at. There are X options for generating a summary, \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: PageRank - cosine similarity**\n",
    "This is a implementation adpated from a blog and all the code is in the text_summary script. This method is the slowest. Loading the embeddings takes a while so you can save the embeddings the first time it is run and then save it to a variable and use it in the subsquent summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pre-trained embeddings must be downloaded locally. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Variation TextRank - BM25 similarity** \n",
    "This is present in the Gensim package and has been optimized to be fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods give similary summaries and have overlapping sentences. For detailed examples of use read the documentation for generate_text_summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running from the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook can be run from the command line and it will print to screen the summary. **create an option where it writes the summary to a text file or something**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
