BC Stats Proposal - Quantifying the Responses to Open-Ended Survey
Questions
================

# Executive Summary

# Introduction

The BC Public Service is committed to understanding the challenges
within the workplace so they can make continous improvements for thier
employees. One of the ways this is quantified is through the work
environment survey (WES) which aims to measure key drivers like job
satisifcation and engagment. The results of the survey are summarized
into two main reports explaining the qualitative and quantitative data
at the organization, ministry and department level.

This project has two main goals which is to automate qualitative
labeling and to gain new insights of the qualitative and quantitative
data. Currently before the qualitative report can be generated the
responses have to be manually coded into more than 60 sub-themes, we
would like to automate this process to reduce the time and cost of
generating the qualitative report. There are two new insights we are
planning on providing in this project, the first is relating the
qualitative and quantitative responses which will help BC Stats to
understand how the qualitative and quantiative reports support each
other. The second analysis will look how the trends have changed over
time and what questions are driving these changes over times. This can
help BC Stats to understand the trend drivers over time.

The main objectives have been broken into three research questions:

1.  What is the best method to code the themes and sub-themes to the
    qualitative responses?

2.  How well does the sentiment of the qualitative responses agree with
    the quantitative responses?

3.  What trends exist over time and across departments from the 2008 to
    2018 quantitative survey data?

There are three main objectives and deliverables. To answer the first
research question, we will train a topic model that can be used to label
future survey data and provide the model. Next the qualitative responses
will be analyzed for their sentiment which will be matched with the
sentiment provided in the quantitative results and a report explaining
the qualitative sentiment and the correlation will be provided. The
final question will be answered by creating an interactive dashboard
that shows the trends over time at different scale as well as how each
question contributes to the overall score.

notes

Objectives - automate process why - speed of process, reduce costs

  - provide other insights why - understand history, strengthen claims
    about current data

deliverables - model - report - dashboard
