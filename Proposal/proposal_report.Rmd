# Executive Summary



# Introduction

The BC Public Service is committed to understanding the challenges within the workplace to make improvements for employees. To achieve this goal a work environment survey (WES) is conducted to measure drivers like job satisfaction and engagement. The results of each survey are rolled up into two main reports explaining the qualitative and quantitative results at the organization, ministry and department level. 

This project has two main goals which are to automate qualitative labeling and new insights about the results. Currently before the qualitative report can be generated the responses have to be manually coded into more than 50 themes. To automate this process would reduce costs by decreasing the time it takes code. There were two new analysis identified and will be completed. The first being the qualitative and quantitative responses are analyzed and reported separated. Second will be looking at how the scores of the drivers have changed over time.
The research questions this project will answer include: 

1. What is the best method to code the themes and sub-themes to the qualitative responses?

2. How well does the sentiment of the qualitative responses agree with the quantitative responses?

3. What trends exist over time and across departments from the 2008 to 2018 quantitative survey data?

There are three main objectives and deliverables. To answer the first research question, we will train a topic model that can be used to label future survey data and provide the model. Next the qualitative responses will be analyzed for their sentiment which will be matched with the sentiment provided in the quantitative results and a report explaining the qualitative sentiment and the correlation will be provided. The final question will be answered by creating an interactive dashboard that shows the trends over time at different scale as well as how each question contributes to the overall score.
