# Contributing

### How to Contribute
1. Clone the master repository to your computer locally `git clone <master_repo_URL>` 
2. Create task/feature branch of the master repository on Bash `git branch <feature_branch_name>`
3. Link the master and branch `git push -u origin <feature_branch_name>`
4. Switch `head` to the branch `git checkout <feature_branch_name>`
5. Work on the local repository and push the changes to the repository `git commit -a -m "<commit_message>"`
6. Send a pull request from the branch to master
7. A team mate who did not send the pull request will review and merge or decline the pull request 
8. Once done with the branch, close the branch

### Communication
To ensure open and transparent communication create an issue in the master repository. When there are task oriented issues, before working on the task add a comment assigning the task to yourself.
If you see a bug or typo either create an issue so the teammate responsible for the file is aware or fix the issue yourself and send a pull request.

### Commit Messages
When adding new files or making changes to existing files write simple and descriptive commit messages. For readability have:
- one commit message per task
- the title of the file (add the purpose if the title is not a good description)
- the changes in the file is being updated

### Outside & Future Contributors
This repository has been created for a course project and may not be monitored after the course.
